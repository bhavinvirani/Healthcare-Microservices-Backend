# Healthcare Microservices Backend

A cloud-ready, containerized **Java Spring Boot** backend for a healthcare management system, designed using a **microservices architecture**. This backend enables asynchronous communication, high availability, and efficient scalability across multiple services.

---

### üöÄ Features

- **Patient Management Service**: Handles patient registration, updates, and information retrieval.
- **Appointment Service**: Manages appointment booking, status updates, and scheduling.
- **Notification Service**: Sends alerts via message queue integration.
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Powered by **Kafka** and **gRPC** for robust inter-service messaging.
- **API Gateway**: Unified entry point for all client requests.
- **Service Discovery**: Dynamically locates services using **Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka**.
- **Containerization**: Dockerized services orchestrated via Docker Compose.
- **Cloud Deployment**: Built to deploy on **AWS ECS**, using RDS for persistence and Kafka for stream processing.

```


Each microservice has its own **database schema**, allowing independent scaling and failure isolation.

### üß™ How to Run (Dev Setup)

#### ‚úÖ Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose
- JDK 17+
- Maven
- Kafka & Zookeeper (Dockerized)

#### üèÅ Steps

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bhavinvirani/Healthcare-Microservices-Backend.git
   cd Healthcare-Microservices-Backend
   ```

2. **Start Kafka & Zookeeper (via Docker)**
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f kafka-docker-compose.yml up -d
   ```

3. **Start Microservices**
   Each service (patient, appointment, notification) can be run independently using:
   ```bash
   cd patient-service
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

4. **Access Eureka Dashboard**
   - [http://localhost:8761](http://localhost:8761)

5. **Use Postman or frontend client to test endpoints via the Gateway**
   - API Gateway: `http://localhost:8080`

---

### üì¶ Docker Deployment (All Services)

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up --build
```

---

### üå©Ô∏è Cloud Deployment (AWS ECS)

- Docker images are pushed to **ECR**
- Services deployed via **ECS + Fargate**
- **RDS PostgreSQL** for production-grade persistence
- Secure configuration through **Secrets Manager**

---

### üìà Future Enhancements

- JWT-based security and authentication gateway
- Centralized logging with ELK stack or CloudWatch
- Monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana
- CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions or AWS CodePipeline
